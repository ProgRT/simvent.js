*simvent.js* is a javascript library for the simulation of phenomenons
relative to mechanical ventilation of the lung.

It can be used to simulate basic modes of ventilation like CMV-VC or
exotic ones like HFPV. It includes basic lung models with linear
compliance and models with sigmoid pressure volume relation and
hysteresis between inspiration and expiration. It can also simulate
patient spontaneous breathing and patient ventilator interactions.

## How to use

simvent.js can be imported in the browser, node.js or observablehq as
an ES6 module.
